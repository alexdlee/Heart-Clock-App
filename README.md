# Heart Clock
Welcome to the Heart Clock iOS application, an app that triggers alarms based on the user's heart rate. Have you ever woken up to your alarm, turned it off, then fallen back asleep? How about fallen asleep during a lecture or while studying? The Heart Clock application solves these problems by monitoring the user's heart rate and checking if it is at or below the threshold of the user's sleeping heart rate. If a sleeping heart rate is detected, an alarm is triggered until the user wakes back up and turns it off.

## Features
Uses Apple Watch to track user's heart rate and accelerometer data in order to trigger alarms. Users are also able to activate different types of alarms based on activity - sleeping, studying, lecture - which can be customized with different ringtones, and can be either on vibration or ringer mode.

# Future Modifications
Would like to upload ringtones to application for alarm customization. Would like to potentially implement a driving mode, which would track a falling heart rate and warn drivers to take a break as soon as possible.
